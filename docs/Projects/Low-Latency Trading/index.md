The project is taken from ["Building Low Latency Applications with C++: Develop a complete low latency trading ecosystem from scratch using modern C++"](https://www.packtpub.com/en-us/product/building-low-latency-applications-with-c-9781837639359), from Sourav Ghosh.

The aim by following his code was:
* to learn new coding standards/ways of writing C++17/20;
* to see C++ applied on a low-latency context; and
* to learn about digital trading ecosystems.

I believe the goals have been achieved and I am confident of the reasons and ways of doing of the code.
Note: apart from extra comments, I've written an additional Markdown file per `.hpp`/`.cpp` pair explaining the respective class and its implementation.
